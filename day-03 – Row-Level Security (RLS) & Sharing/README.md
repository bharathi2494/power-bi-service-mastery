# DAY 3 – Row-Level Security (RLS) & Sharing (Power BI)
## Topics Covered:
- Static Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Dynamic RLS using USERPRINCIPALNAME()
- Object-Level Security (OLS)
- Report sharing vs App sharing (best practices)

## Hands-on Practice
- Create Dynamic RLS roles in Power BI Desktop
- Publish dataset and assign users to roles in Power BI Service
- Validate security using View as Role
- Test real user behavior through Power BI App

## Key Learnings
- Secure data at row and object level
- Implement scalable, enterprise-grade security
- Understand why App sharing is preferred over report sharing
  
**RLS is applied at the dataset level, ensuring consistent security across all reports.**  
**“RLS is evaluated at dataset level in Power BI Service, not in Desktop.”**
